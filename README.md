##### This plugin integrates ALM Octane with TFS, enabling ALM Octane to display TFS build pipelines and track build and test run results.

## Installation instructions

1. Download latest msi release setup from : [releases](https://github.com/MicroFocus/octane-tfs-plugin/releases)
2. Run setup
3. Configure all relevant fields following the [Configure the setup](#Configure the connection)

### Configuring the TFS ci plugin to connect to ALM Octane
#### Before you configure the connection:
1. Ask the ALM Octane shared space admin for an API access Client ID and Client secret. The plugin uses these for authentication when
communicating with ALM Octane. The access keys must be assigned the CI/CD Integration role in all relevant workspaces. For details, see Set up API access for integration.
2. To enable the TFS server to communicate with ALM Octane, make sure the server can access the Internet. If your network requires a proxy to connect to the Internet, setup the required proxy configuration.
3. Decide which Bamboo user ALM Octane will use to execute jobs on the server.

#### Configure the setup
During the msi setup
Enter the following information in the relevant fields:

**Installation folder**: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Team Foundation Server 15.0\Application Tier\TFSJobAgent\Plugins\

      This folder is provided by default and should be changed only if TFS installation path is different from the default

**Location**: http:// Octane fully qualified domain name / IP address> {:}/ui/?p=
For example, in this URL, the shared space ID is 1002:  http://myServer.myCompany.com:8081/ui/?p=1002

**Client ID/Secret**: Ask the ALM Octane shared space admin for an API access Client ID and Client secret. The plugin uses these for authentication when communicating with ALM Octane

**Client ID/Secret**: Ask the ALM Octane shared space admin for an API access Client ID and Client secret. The plugin uses these for authentication when communicating with ALM Octane

**Team foundation server location URL**: [Machine]:8080\tfs
  This is default TFS configuration, unless was changed during TFS Installation

**PAT** (TFS Personal access token)**: The token should be configured by TFS admin (see [PAT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate) )

**After the connection is set up**, open ALM Octane, define a CI server and create pipelines.
For details, see Integrate with your CI server in the ALM Octane Help.
